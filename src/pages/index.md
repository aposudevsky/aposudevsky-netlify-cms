        Gatsby allows you to build blazing fast websites by building static
        pages out of your content. It can use data from multiple data sources
        like Markdown, APIs and CMSes (Drupal, Wordpress, Umbraco, etc.) Being
        written in NodeJS and using React under the hood it allows creating
        truly fascinating user experience.

        Drupal is a free, open-source content management system (CMS) with a
        large, supportive community. While it's really powerful in arranging all
        sorts of content into well-formed structures, it offers a lot more,
        including building eCommerce websites, blogs, landing pages and all
        sorts of portals.

        React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It is
        maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and
        companies.


        React can be used as a base in the development of single-page or mobile
        applications, as it's optimal only for its intended use of being the
        quickest method to fetch rapidly changing data that needs to be
        recorded.

  heading: Great coffee with no compromises
  description: >
    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.

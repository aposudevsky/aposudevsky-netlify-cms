      text: Shade of 80% of all websites on the internet are build with PHP. 
        The language evolved quite a lot during past few years 
        and now contributes to fast development, maintaining high performance and quality.
        Frameworks like Symfony, Laravel, Zend Framework and CMSes like Drupal, Wordpress are written in PHP

    - icon: FaDrupal
      text: Drupal is a free, open-source content management system (CMS) with a
        large, supportive community. While it's really powerful in arranging all
        sorts of content into well-formed structures, it offers a lot more,
        including building eCommerce websites, blogs, landing pages and all
        sorts of portals
      title: Drupal
    - icon: GrGatsbyjs
      text: Gatsby allows you to build blazing fast websites by building static pages
        out of your content. It can use data from multiple data sources like
        Markdown, APIs and CMSes (Drupal, Wordpress, Umbraco, etc.) Being
        written in NodeJS and using React under the hood it allows creating
        truly fascinating user experience
      title: Gatsby
    - icon: FaReact
      text: >-
        React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It is
        maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and
        companies.
        React can be used as a base in the development of single-page or mobile applications, as it's optimal only for its intended use of being the quickest method to fetch rapidly changing data that needs to be recorded
      title: React
    - icon: FaMobileAlt
      text: PWA is a technique to make your website look and feel like a native app on
        any platform. IOS, Android, Windows phone, Desktop app - all looks
        native to its platform. In combination with Service Workers PWA can do a
        lot of things, such as work offline, background syncing, push
        notifications and many more
      title: Progressive web apps
    - icon: FaFileCode
      text: I work with different hosting platforms such as Netlify, Pantheon, AWS 
        and architect microservices using most suitable tech such as AWS lambda functions or web services. 
        Other technologies I use are NodeJS, Jest, GraphQL, Algolia search, Sanity, NetlifyCMS, MongoDB, ElasticSearch and Redis cache

  heading: Great coffee with no compromises
  description: >
    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.
